## Technologies & Languages  
Here is an overview of the main technologies, frameworks and programming languages used in this project:

- **Python** – The core backend logic is implemented in Python. According to GitHub’s language statistics for this repository, ~20 % is Python. 
- **HTML** – A significant portion (~78 %) of the repository is HTML files (templates / frontend).
- **Django** (or a similar Python web-framework) – The presence of `manage.py`, `requirements.txt`, `auth_app`, and `gitgauge` directories suggests that a Django project structure is used.  
- **Web templating / Frontend** – The `templates/` directory contains HTML files for the user interface.  
- **Virtual environment / Dependency management** – The `requirements.txt` file lists Python dependencies needed to run the application.  
- **Git & GitHub** – As the project is hosted on GitHub, version control is managed via Git; the project name (“GitGauge”) suggests it interacts with Git usage / metrics, though you may want to elaborate.  
- **Environment variables / Configuration** – The presence of a `.env.example` file indicates the usage of environment‐specific configuration (e.g., secrets, credentials, API keys).  
- **Directory structure** –  
  - `auth_app/` — likely handles authentication and user-management.  
  - `gitgauge/` — likely the main Django app (or module) for the project logic.  
  - `templates/` — HTML templates for frontend views.  
  - `manage.py` — typical entry point for a Django project.  
  - `requirements.txt` — dependencies.  
  - `.gitignore` — files/directories to exclude from version control.  
  - `.env.example` — sample environment configuration.
